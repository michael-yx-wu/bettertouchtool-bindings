I no longer store my bettertouchtool preferences and keybindings separately from my dotfiles. From now on I'll be updating my preferences in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/michael-yx-wu/environment).

# bettertouchtool-bindings
Custom shortcuts for BetterTouchTool

## Installation
To import bindings into BetterTouchTool:
- Open BetterTouchTool preferences
- Click on 'import' and select the shortcut file you would like to import
